# TURNER_Portfolio_Challenge_02
Weekly Challenge #2 - Personal Developer Portfolio for Mark Turner

## Project Description

This project was to create a website to serve as a central portfolio to showcase my background as well as coding skills and projects. 

### Advanced CSS

One of the main points at this juncture (September 20222) during the creation of the site was the usage of more advanced CSS techniques. This website includes .hover techniques and media queries to help make the site more interactive as well as responsive to different screen sizes.

## Coding Projects

One thing to note at this point is that the coding projects are all marked as coming soon, and will be replaced with updated and completed projects as they come online. The existing boxes are placeholders for both bootcamp projects and several personal projects under design.
